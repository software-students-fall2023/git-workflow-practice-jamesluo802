2. I find this article interesting because it gives insight into the career path of a software engineer. She talks about her whole journey from wanting to originally be a doctor and pivoting into computer science. She addresses some common misconceptions about being a software engineer and gives helpful advice to those who want to pursue it as a career such as software engineering actually being very collaborative. 

## Comment from lnbernstein: 
	- This article is fascinating because it is incredibly rare for a software engineer to start as wanting to be a doctor. Additionally, talking about the accessibility of intro comp sci courses is so crucial for continuing to grow the field of software engineering. This is incredibly applicable to life as a student as I attempt to make tech more prevalent at NYU through my work at the Business Analytics Club!
