2. I find this article interesting because it gives insight into the career path of a software engineer. She talks about her whole journey from wanting to originally be a doctor and pivoting into computer science. She addresses some common misconceptions about being a software engineer and gives helpful advice to those who want to pursue it as a career such as software engineering actually being very collaborative.

	- This article is fascinating because it is incredibly rare for a software engineer to start as wanting to be a doctor. Additionally, talking about the accessibility of intro comp sci courses is so crucial for continuing to grow the field of software engineering. This is incredibly applicable to life as a student as I attempt to make tech more prevalent at NYU through my work at the Business Analytics Club!

This article is helpful, as I am a senior and will need to secure a job soon. It also points out a point of frustration for me, the seemingly pointless coding questions that interviewers pose. None of the interview questions I've had have been something that would be useful in an actual workplace, and it just seems strange and disconnected. Perhaps the worst of it is when I apply to a position and I immediately get a reply linking me to a timed exam which says it takes an estimated 2 hours to complete. This article reaffirms my knowledge that only the first step is the most difficult, as later on it would be mostly recruiters approaching.
